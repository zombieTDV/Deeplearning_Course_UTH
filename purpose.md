Practice 2 - Hands-on practice with pre-trained neural network architectures
Exercises:

1) Experiment with different pre-trained models
   (VGG, DenseNet, etc.).
2) Adjust the hyperparameters (learning rate, batch
   size, etc.).
3) Use TensorBoard to monitor the training process.
   Objective:
   ● Become familiar with loading and using pre-trained
   models from torchvision.models.
   ● Understand how to adapt and fine-tune pre-trained
   models for specific tasks.
   Steps:

1. Environment Setup:
   ● Ensure you have PyTorch and torchvision installed.
   ● If not, install them using: pip install torch torchvision
2. Load a Pre-trained Model:
   ● torchvision.models provides various pre-trained
   models like ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, etc.
   ● pretrained=True loads weights pre-trained on the
   ImageNet dataset.
3. Explore the Model Architecture:
   ● Print the model to examine its structure.
   ● Identify the layers and parameters of the model.
4. Adapt the Model for a Specific Task:
   ● Typically, the final layer of a pre-trained model (the
   classification layer) needs to be replaced to match the number
   of classes in your dataset.
   ● You can freeze earlier layers to prevent them from updating
   weights during retraining (transfer learning).
   ● Or you can unfreeze a few of the final layers to fine-tune the
   model.
5. Prepare the Data:
   ● Load and prepare your dataset.
   ● Use torchvision.transforms to preprocess the data.
   ● Use torch.utils.data.DataLoader to create data batches.
6. Train the Model:
   ● Define the loss function and optimizer.
   ● Write the training loop to train the model on your dataset.
7. Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model's performance on a test
   dataset.
